When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

# Steps to install and drun a new project

first clone the repo

then create a new branch and make a pull request to make changes, if needed.

have the request reviewed

then start docker with docker compose up.

install the deps with npm install --legacy-peer-deps if you are having install issues.

install deps for both backend and frontend folders

run the start script on both in different terminals.
